This ia collection of APWorlds that don't have a Github.  These can include:
- The randomizer is abandoned.
- The randomizer was deemed unsuitable for the Discord and was removed.
- The developer did not deem it necessary to make a Github repository for their work.

This is done for a little personal project to document stuff more openly.  Many of these can be found in the Archipelago Discord.  Many APworlds credit their developer(s) within their __init__.py file.
